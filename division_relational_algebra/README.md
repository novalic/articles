# Understanding the Division Operator in Relational Algebra

The division operator might be the hardest operator to understand on the relational algebra query language. I've seen many people confused about it, and personally I had a hard time with it when I was studying relational algebra. I was solving some queries and found an incorrect solution on a complex query (I didn't know it was incorrect!) that confused me a lot. So while I found out it was wrong (a professor from my university corrected it) I found out an easy way of seeing what the operator does. I wrote it all down hoping it will help someone some day.
