# Math problems

These are some interesting math problems on which I programmed solutions.

## [388](/388)

- A nice problem about finding multiples of 388 that verify some rules.
- It includes a nice line-of-code-solution on Python.

## [Strategies for Natural Deduction on Predicate Logic](/natural_deduction)

- How to build a derivation in predicate logic.
- How to use identity rules.
