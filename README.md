### 388

- A nice problem about finding multiples of 388 that verify some rules.
- It includes a nice line-of-code-solution on Python.

### How graphic data was stored in the N.E.S. CHRom

- A guide to understand how data was stored in CHR roms.
- I try to explain what I learned by investigating several sourcer.
- It has examples.

### Strategies for Natural Deduction on Predicate Logic

- How to build a derivation in predicate logic.
- How to use identity rules.

### Understanding the division operator in Relational Algebra

- A nice guide to understand what the operator does.
- Examples with tables.
- A relational algebra query.
