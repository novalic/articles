# 388

This is a nice problem that formed part of my University's math workshops for highschool students:
```
How many numbers of 7 or less digits whose last 3 (digits) are 388 are multiples of 388?
```
It is indeed a really nice mathematical problem.

## What is on this repository?
- A pdf file with a quick and (more or less) formal solution that doesn't involve much theory. [Check it](https://github.com/novalic/mathProblems/blob/master/388/388.pdf)
- The latex file of the pdf document.
- A python file with the code to check the solution.
